# OpenMRS TestNG Project

# Description
OpenMRS is an open-source electronic health record system used for managing, storing, and sharing patient data in healthcare facilities. It is specifically designed to improve healthcare services, particularly in low-income countries. This platform supports crucial functionalities such as digitizing medical records, patient tracking, treatment planning, and analysis of health data.

The OpenMRS Project is an open-source initiative developed by a community. Software developers, healthcare professionals, and volunteers collaborate within the project to enhance the management of healthcare data. OpenMRS offers a user-friendly interface and is adaptable for various healthcare organizations.
